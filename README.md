# Deep-Learning-A-Z

This the code for the implementation of the neural networks that was taught during the course [Deep Learning A-Z™: Hands on Artificial Neural Networks](https://www.udemy.com/course/deeplearning/) course provided by Udemy.
To help me understand the code later, I have commented explanations of various code segments through-out. Hope it may be helpful for others as well.

To find the official dataset templates and related research papers, visit  [SuperDataScience.com](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/deep-learning)

The code can be easily implemented and used with custom datasets and parameters.

The code and datasets are for:
1. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
4. Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
5. Boltzmann Machines (BM)
6. AutoEncoders (AE)
